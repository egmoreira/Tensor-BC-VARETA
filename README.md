# BC-VARETA-toolbox
BC-VARETA is a novel methodology, for estimating the Inverse Solution (sources activity) and its Precision Matrix (connectivity parameters) in the frequency domain representation of Stationary Time Series. The aims of this method are three. First: Joint estimation of Source Activity and Connectivity as a frequency domain linear dynamical system identification approach. Second: Achieve super high resolution in the connectivity estimation through Sparse Hermitian Sources Graphical Model. Third: To be a populational approach, preventing the Inverse Solution and Connectivity statistical analysis across subjects as a postprocessing, by modeling population features of Source Activity and Connectivity. Our claims are supported by a wide simulation framework using realistic head models, realistic Sources Setup, and Inverse Crime effects evaluation.
